# Don't weaponize Political Correctness! Radical Cancel Culture breads Hate Speech!
#
# It's more important to fight for real FREE software then use an old f*** and some misunderstood 
# or stupid things he said to tear down the FSF. Don't let FSF get destroyed! 
#
# And there is a difference between Corproate OpenSource Programs (COSP) like Linux Foundation 
# or CNCF and real FREE and OpenSource (FOSS)!
#
# BTW GNOME foundation inhibits some radical leftists. Still I <3 GNOME ;)  also I have no
# problem adopting the Creater's Covenenant since it is a good Code of Conduct. 
#
# But I'd rather listen to what RMS says than some of self-radicalisating bullshit 
# Coraline Ada Ehmke talks. Let us cooperate and make a standpoint for FREE software
# and not give by the grudge of a trans-woman or the business interests of corporations.
#
# FREE software is inclusive software!
