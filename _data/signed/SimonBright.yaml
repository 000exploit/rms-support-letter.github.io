name : Simon Bright ( I help people solve their problems and learn Linux! Also in my free time I compile kernels for Debian 
with support for F-Sync and Futex2 patchsets, with support for Ashmem and Binder for Anbox, so that people can easily get the opportunity to play on GNU/Linux 
and at the same time not lose the ability to work!)
