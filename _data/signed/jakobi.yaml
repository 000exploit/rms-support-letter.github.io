comment: Whenever I think RMS' point of view being annoying, it pays for me to 
         tripple-check. Often enough, it was me being too optimistic or missing 
         important points in considering a problem. We DO NEED more uncompromising 
         people who think out-of-the-box and ANNOY with their INSISTANCE AND
         their INSIGHTs.
