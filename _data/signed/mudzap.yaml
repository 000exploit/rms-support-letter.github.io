I believe what RMS said was dumb, and not within reason, however, no one else has fought and done so much as him regarding free software and freedom derived from it.
Originally I wouldn't see much sense on signing this, but I find it worrying the fact that many opposers of RMS hold some relationship or depend on large organizations, from which not all have exactly the best records regarding their interests around 'freedom'.
Not only that, I can't but express disgust for ideologists pushing their phony morals and extremist solutions.
